	My name is Claudia Luna aka Randomluna, I am 16 yrs old and I had recently discovered how much 
I actually love to write. I had always loved to read but had recently put my imagination onto paper, letting
my weird and random mind go free. I had actually finished my first story on Wattpad titled "Instant Death"
for it being my fisrt book/stoty written on Wattpad I think I did well. Apart from that, I had gotten ideas
from other stories on Wattpad mainly stories that are mystery. Anyway that's a little biography about me.
If you're ever on Wattpad I recommend checking out my story "Instant Death". Thank You! <a href="http://www.wattpad.com/user/Randomluna">Randomluna!!!!</a>

	Instant Death tells the story of Selena and Ana Marke. Twin sisters living in a small town. One day 
Ana just... disappears. After 3 years since her sister 'death' Selena decides that its a good idea to leave 
to New York with her dad. There she meets Michael and they begin their friendship.. later relationship. 
For Ana's 5 years anniversary, Selena decides to go back home to pay her respects, but when she does she
discovers a lot of things of her mother,sister, and her childhood best friend. 
I love how I wrote the Epilogue... and its not because I wrote it.
